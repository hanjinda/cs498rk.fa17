    	<div class="heading">Final Project: Your Own Web App!</div>

    	<p><span class="section-heading">Overview</span></p>

<p>Your goal is to <strong>create a database-backed web application which utilizes a RESTful API</strong> with the following constraints:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your team may only consist of 4-5 people, with each person having a <strong>specific</strong> role.</li>
  <li>Your project must be a web application that has a frontend, an API, JavaScript backend, and at least one database.</li>
  <li>Your project needs to have user authentication.</li>
  <li>Your project needs to have a heuristic evaluation with at least one revision. Make sure you plan time for this.</li>
  <li>Your project must have a strong focus on design, primarily in user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and responsiveness.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="section-heading">Part A: Proposal</span></p>

<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Due - <em>Nov 8</em>, 2017, 11.59PM CST</strong></span></p>

<p>Fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/6wf6j6qrOyHGt3Rm2">this short Google form</a> with your team information</p>

<p>Upload a <strong>one-page</strong> PDF proposal to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4tQ-T8q3gPESm9lTXFMdVYxN00?usp=sharing">this Google drive folder</a> containing the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Team Name</li>
  <li>Team Members (Names and NetIDs)</li>
  <li>Three Project Proposals with the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Statement + Motivation</li>
      <li>User problems you are solving</li>
      <li>Basic interactions your app will support in service of goal</li>
      <li>Other apps that are similar</li>
      <li>How your app is different</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is no length requirement for the proposals, but they should cover all the information above.</p>

<p><span class="section-heading">Part B: Functional Prototypes</span></p>

<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Due - <em>November 29</em>, 2017, In Class</strong></span></p>

<p>During class, teams will perform heuristic evaluations of each other’s prototypes and give feedback.</p>

<p>Prototypes should capture at least three of the key interactions in your team’s web app. The prototypes can be done digitally (using software like powerpoint or balsamiq), but should be printed and brought to class. During class, the TAs will be walking around grading prototypes for quality and completion.</p>

<p><span class="section-heading">Part C: Final Presentation</span></p>

<p><span style="color: red"><strong>Due - <em>Dec 13</em>, 2017, Before Class</strong></span></p>

<p>On the final day of class, your overall deliverables are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Source Code for the Project / URL to GitHub Repository</li>
  <li>URL to your hosted project</li>
  <li>No longer than 3-minute video detailing your web app’s purpose, design, and functionality</li>
  <li>~~Peer evaluation~~</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Final Project Competition @ Research Park</b></p>

<p>Everyone is invited to come to Research Park Atrium on December 13th (time TBD) to enjoy refreshments and watch presentations given by the top projects.</p>

<p>The address for Research Park is: 60 Hazelwood Dr, Champaign, IL 61820. To get to Research Park via CUMTD, follow <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cumtd.com/maps-and-schedules/route/1-yellow/weekday/daytime/map/">this map</a>.</p>

<p>Out of the final projects, the Course Staff will choose the best 10-13 projects to present at Research Park. The presentations will consist of 3 minutes for the video and 5 minutes for a Q&amp;A session. Industry experts from Research Park will be present in order to judge your projects and ask questions.</p>

<p>The judges will then choose the best projects to receive awards (TBD).</p>

<p><b>Video Requirements</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>3-minutes length max</li>
  <li>Should focus on design and functionality</li>
  <li>Use screen capture software (SnagIt/ScreenFlow (Mac)/Camstasia/Quicktime)</li>
  <li>Demo the important user flows</li>
  <li>Voice-over should tell a concrete story: user, problem, and how your app solves it</li>
  <li>Communicate the motivation behind design decisions (e.g. <em>how did heuristic evaluation play a role in changes that were made to the interface?</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Grade Breakdown</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>proposal/prototypes (10%)</li>
  <li>video (15%)</li>
  <li>design (UX, UI, responsiveness, evaluation) (35%)</li>
  <li>front end implementation (15%)</li>
  <li>back end implementation (15%)</li>
  <li>user authentication (10%)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Submission Instructions</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Each team should fill out the project submission <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW5LZvgP3fwi6RV1QGNZZafHM0ynpLiSr1t0u3kl-zl7nVZA/viewform?usp=sf_link">form</a> exactly ONCE.</li>
